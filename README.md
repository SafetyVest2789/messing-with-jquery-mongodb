# messing-with-jquery-mongodb
This was a brutal learning experience on using jquery
the syntax was new, using JSON index for mongodb was new, and having issues with the correct syntax for the auto-comlete was long and painful.

I truly am grateful from learning modules and developers in my community introducing me to new implements and code. For instance autocomplete is a feature that helps introduce user input/interface methods. It's a new tool and can be beneficial for other applications. A big thanks to the help MayanWolfe made in breakingdown of JQuery usage, Virtual Coffee Devs on helping understand newer versions of JQuery, and the 100Devs community troublshooting code with me. 

This might be a simple few lines of code, but it is a great little learning curve to have problem solve.
